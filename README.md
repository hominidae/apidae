# What is apidae?

 apidae is a packaged system for monitoring beehive's. Specifically, measuring and monitoring
temperature, humidity and other factors affecting bee hive health.

## Okay, so it's a bee hive monitor. What's cool about that?

 apidae is intended to utilize an 3G/4G-LTE mobile internet sticks to remotely connect the sensors to
the internet via MQTT.

### Pre-requisites

 So far, on the USB modem side the only supported 3G/4G USB Modem supported is the Huawei LTE E8372.

 You will also need a Raspberry Pi B+, Raspberry Pi 2, or Raspberry Pi Zero or Zero W.

 You will also need a powered USB hub.

 You will need ds1b20 i2c temperature sensors, telephone wiring and the humidity sensors.

 The humidity or hygrometers are currently not defined as I am looking for an appropriate
 i2c sensor.
